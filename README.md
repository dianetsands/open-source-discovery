## Worth: 20
## Due: Sunday, March 17, 11:59pm
## Background

Read this page and watch the embedded videos. https://www.makeuseof.com/tag/open-source-vs-free-software/

Feel free to do your own additional research to help answer the questions below

## Directions
_Answer the questions below by editing this document and committing it to this file._ 

### Part 1 (3 pts each):
1. Why does Richard Stallman believe software must be "free?" To respect the users freedom and community. Free software 

2. What do you think of Stallman's notion of software that controls its users rather than users who control the software? Is there any software that makes you feel like that? This is true of most software in that users interact with it, rather than run it. As a librarian, I have access to admin accounts which allow for the next level - I feel more incontrol of the software, because I set things up for the users to do. Still, in most software, even that reach is limited.

3. Why does Allison Randal say that companies who don't use open source software are at a disadvantage? Open source is where innovation is happening these days, and propritary software is lagging behind.

4. Why does Linus Torvalds think that the GPLv3 is "overreaching?" "i give you source code, but you have to use my rules," Torvalds does not see that this is the same as version 2.

### Part 2 (1 pt each): 
Identify software that you use on a regular basis or which you have heard about which is distributed with an open source license. Do not select software that is listed in the syllabus for this course.

1. What is the name of the software? Koha

2. What is the software version? 19.1

3. What is the name of the license is it distributed under? Koha® and the Koha logo are trademarks of LibLime in the United States. Copyright © 2020 LibLime. All rights reserved.

4. What are conditions for re-distributing the software? Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

5. What are conditions for modifying the software? You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified it, and giving a relevant date.
The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is released under this License and any conditions added under section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to “keep intact all notices”.
You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts, regardless of how they are packaged. This License gives no permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your work need not make them do so.

6. Where can the source code be acquired (link)?  https://koha-community.org/download-koha/

7. Where can you report and track bugs?  https://bugs.koha-community.org/

8. How can become a contributor to this project? A “contributor” is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  https://koha-community.org/
